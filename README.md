# The Ra Planetary System — Interactive 3D Simulation

A self-contained, browser-based 3D orrery of the **Ra (10 Tauri)** system from the
*Satis* worldbuilding document — the star, its eight planets, their moons, and the
brown-dwarf companion **Horus** with its own four worlds.

## How to run

**Just double-click `index.html`** (or open it in any modern browser — Chrome,
Firefox, Edge). No server, no internet, no installation required. Everything runs
locally.

### Two reading modes (one page, **📖** toggle)

Each world opens with a short, readable **summary**, followed by your *exact* words from the
source document underneath (where the document describes that world). The **📖** button in the
bottom bar flips between:

- **Summary + source** (default) — the summary, then your verbatim text beneath it.
- **Author's text** — your *exact* words only, with no summary and no paraphrasing.

(Worlds the document hasn't described yet — Shu, Horus, Khonsu, Nut, Osiris — show only the
summary in the default mode, and a short note in author's-text mode.)

## What's inside

- **Every body from the document**, placed on Keplerian elliptical orbits with
  physically-scaled *relative* orbital speeds (inner worlds race, outer worlds crawl).
- **Photoreal surface maps** for every world (with a procedural texture baked into the
  browser as an instant fallback): banded gas giants, the blue-marble ocean of Uat-Ur,
  Satis's violet-forested continents, the rusty deserts of Set, molten Sekhmet, the
  brown-dwarf glow of Horus, and more.
- **Click any world** (or use the list on the left, or click its label) to fly the
  camera to it and open a data panel with its real figures, a description, and the
  AI-rendered concept art from the document.

## Controls

| Action | How |
| --- | --- |
| Orbit camera | Left-drag |
| Zoom | Scroll wheel |
| Orbit camera (alt) | Right-drag |
| Pan | Middle-drag |
| Focus a world | Click it / pick from the list / click its label |
| Play / pause | Bottom bar |
| Time speed | "Speed" slider (0.05× – 40×, logarithmic) |
| Exaggerate sizes | "Size" slider |
| Real ↔ Compressed orbits | "Scale" button, bottom bar |
| Author's text ↔ Summary | "📖" button, bottom bar |
| Toggle orbits / labels | Bottom bar |
| Reset view | Bottom bar |
| Help & glossary | **?** button, top-right |
| Deep-link a world | open `index.html#satis` (any body key) |

## A note on scale

The system spans from a hot Neptune at **0.05 AU** to a brown dwarf at **46 AU** — a
~950× range — and body diameters range from ~2,500 km moons to a 126,000 km brown dwarf.
Two view modes (toggle in the bottom bar):

- **Real scale** (default) — orbits sit at their true distance in AU, so Amunet hugs the
  star and Horus is far out at 46 AU. Zoom out to find Shu and Horus.
- **Compressed** — a non-linear law squeezes the range so the whole system fits on screen
  at once.

Body sizes are exaggerated in both modes (true sizes would be invisible dots). The *real*
figures are always shown in each world's data panel, and relative orbital *speeds* remain
physically correct (Kepler's third law).

## Files

```
index.html                       — the page (shell + UI; 📖 toggles summary/author's text)
assets/app.js                    — 3D engine (Three.js scene, textures, orbits, interaction)
assets/data.js                   — body data, stats, summary descriptions
assets/descriptions-verbatim.js  — the author's word-for-word descriptions
assets/img/                      — concept art extracted from the Satis document
assets/lib/                      — Three.js r132 + OrbitControls (bundled for offline use)
```

To update a world's numbers or summary text, edit `assets/data.js`; to update the
verbatim text, edit `assets/descriptions-verbatim.js`.

## Surface textures

Every world loads a **baked, photoreal surface map** (`assets/img/textures/<key>.jpg`)
by default. Each one has a fast, deterministic **procedural** texture generated in the
browser as an instant first paint and automatic fallback: if a baked map is missing or
fails to load, the world silently keeps its procedural texture, so the page always works.

The maps are **baked once, offline** and committed as plain image files — the page
itself makes no API calls, so it stays openable offline with no key. To (re)generate:

```
node tools/gen-refs.mjs          # 1. render procedural refs + build per-body prompts
                                 #    -> tools/_raw/ref/<key>.png, tools/prompts.json
# 2. generate the raw AI renders (via Codex / gpt-image-2) into tools/_raw/ai/<key>.png
python3 tools/post.py            # 3. seam-blend + downscale -> assets/img/textures/<key>.jpg
```

`tools/texture-core.mjs` is a headless duplicate of the procedural generators from
`assets/app.js` (kept in sync by hand) used only to produce the reference images.
`tools/_raw/` (references + full-res originals) is git-ignored; only the final
`assets/img/textures/*.jpg` are committed.
