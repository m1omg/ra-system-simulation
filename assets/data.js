   The Ra Planetary System — body data
   Source: "Satis v10" worldbuilding document.
   Classification follows the ArcBuilder Planetary Classification List.

   Notes on units / scaling used by the engine:
     - dist  : real orbital semi-major axis in AU (around Ra), or in
               1000 km for moons (used for ordering/labels only).
     - aDisp : DISPLAY semi-major axis in scene units (computed in app.js
               from a compressed power-law so the system is viewable).
     - period: orbital period used for animation pacing (sim "years");
               heliocentric values are physically scaled (Kepler),
               moon values are tuned for pleasant viewing.
     - radiusKm : real mean radius in km (for the info panel).
     - rDisp : DISPLAY radius (computed in app.js, compressed).
